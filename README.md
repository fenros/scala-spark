# Scala-Spark Notebooks

Scala and Spark for beginners.
These notebooks introduce the basic concepts to put your hands on the Scala programming language and the Spark framework.

## Getting Started

To run the code snippets you will need to configure a kernel for scala (see [jupyter-scala](https://github.com/jupyter-scala/jupyter-scala)), or you can also use docker to run the notebooks with an already configured environment:
```
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 jupyter/all-spark-notebook
```
